            <p>It is a new year. All we should focus in doing is being consistent and keep working regularly. Nothing
                but consistency brings success. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop
                until I become web developer.</p>

            <h1>Develop <br>Without Limits</h1>
            <p>It might seem hard to cope up with the speed of the course but if i spend sufficient time nothing is
                impossible. Exams, classes, work will always be there but time management is the key. When to learn the
                stuff
                excuses must be left behind.
